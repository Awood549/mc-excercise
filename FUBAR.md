Sometimes there's so much hair in the drain, I feel like it is taking over my life, and I don't know what to do. 

A lot of the time, when we try to code, we don't actually know what we're doing, and sometimes it'd be nice to know what was going on #firstworldproblems.

We're doing more shit. Yay for more shit.

I don't know what I'm doing.

Help.

Help me please.

Oh dear God. Help me.

Help me Tom Cruise. 

Help me baby Jesus.
